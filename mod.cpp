- Added CPUID specialization for it_filter() so I can release it.

2007-01-26 22:50 UTC - kode54
- Moved IT S70-2 effects alongside the rest of S7x so they all trigger after
  paired notes.
- Integrated note on/cut ramping with volume transition ramping to reduce
  setup/cleanup overhead of calling render_playing and the resampler functions
  for single samples.
- Note on/cut ramping scaled from 7 sample logarithmic and 256 sample linear to
  .75ms and 5ms respectively, both linear.
- Integrated the pattern looping changes from DUMB 0.9.3, since a few files
  seemed to be broken. The XM-only features still needed to be flagged for XM
  so they won't break MOD.

2007-01-24 09:37 UTC - kode54
- Version is now 0.9.8.3

  (if asked twice.mod)

2007-01-21 19:47 UTC - kode54
- Implemented crappy fixed end of sample volume ramping.

2007-01-21 17:43 UTC - kode54

  nonsense.

2007-01-21 14:21 UTC - kode54
- Fixed a bug in IT renderer / get_true_pan that caused it to crash on IT files
  with instruments enabled upon hitting an invalid instrument change.

2006-12-26 06:41 UTC - kode54
- Fixed sample rate reporting for when extra dynamic info is turned off.

2006-11-01 00:50 UTC - kode54
- Resamplers now return immediately if the fixed point delta is zero.
- IT renderer now cuts existing notes when it reaches a note where the instrument
  references an invalid sample. (jumping under trees.it)
- Version is now 0.9.8.2

2006-10-14 08:33 UTC - kode54
- IT renderer pattern loop processor now resets the rows played to clear table
  per channel regardless of whether order changed since last loop start was
  initiated. This is correct, since two pattern loop starts in a row means that
  a loop will never jump to the first loop point.

2006-10-12 06:28 UTC - kode54
- STM reader checks for more values after the song name, reports the correct
  order list size, and ignores samples which are shorter than four bytes or
  have a default volume of zero.

2006-10-08 03:51 UTC - kode54
- Added CP437 graphics to text conversion functions.

2006-10-07 05:24 UTC - kode54
- Simplified volume ramping update code, reducing the size of the resampler code
  considerably.
- Bumped the volume ramping precision to 24 bits of fraction precision, which is
  needed by Sweetsin.xm.
- Moved sample rate reporting to dynamic info as requested by Peter, since it's
  not a property of the files themselves, but user configurable.
- Version is now 0.9.8.1

2006-10-07 03:42 UTC - kode54
- Changed DSMF sample loader to ignore unknown flags instead of blowing an error.

2006-09-25 17:39 UTC - kode54
- Added hack to MOD loader for when sample start is specified in bytes instead of
  words.

2006-09-19 15:05 UTC - kode54
- Shuffled finetune calculation into the correct position, immediately applied
  as delta is calculated from note.
- Promoted IT_SAMPLE finetune property to signed short as char is insufficient
  for full semitone range. (+/- 256)
- Changed resampler to use full 64-bit comparison for todo variable range checking
  which should hopefully eliminate any further problems with pitch slides which go
  out of range.
- Version is now 0.9.8

2006-06-16 19:10 UTC - kode54
- Fixed MOD loader FLT8 handler so it halves the order list after it's allocated
  and loaded.
- Unified renderer and loop restarting for playback and seeking, and made seeking
  abortable.

2006-06-16 09:12 UTC - kode54
- Fixed PSM subsong info reporting.

2006-06-15 21:23 UTC - kode54
- Added finetune property to IT_SAMPLE, modified ASY, MOD, MTM, old PSM, and XM
  to use it instead of adjusting the C5 speed, so that finetune effect overrides
  rather than compounding sample finetune.

2006-06-10 18:10 UTC - kode54
- Fixed volume ramping.

2006-06-09 16:48 UTC - kode54
- Ported most of DUMB 0.9.3 over, except for the conflicting pattern loop change

2006-06-03 02:13 UTC - kode54
- Implemented ASYLUM Music Format support.

2006-06-02 22:06 UTC - kode54

- Reset loop count when seeking backwards.

2006-06-02 21:20 UTC - kode54

  (coffee-blues 3.mod)
- Version is now 0.9.7.5

2006-06-02 20:25 UTC - kode54
- Empty pattern scanner now returns the correct value for completely empty
  pattern structures, and also checks for lists of empty rows.

- STM reader reads effects properly now.

2006-05-31 23:15 UTC - kode54

2006-05-31 18:31 UTC - kode54
- Removed context dialog from resources.

2006-05-30 03:57 UTC - kode54
- IT reader works around a broken file that has several of the instruments
  offset by two bytes from their indicated file offsets. Since the hack
  only checks for offset by two null bytes, it also assumes that the two
  bytes it can't read from the end are also zero. (bz_ult9.it)
- IT reader treats null instrument/sample/pattern offsets as empty items.
  (flight2.it, sherri.it)

2006-05-30 00:04 UTC - kode54
- XM reader now truncates instrument envelope lengths to 12, and performs
  some basic envelope loop checking, similar to Open ModPlug Tracker.
  (revive_nimnone.xm)

2006-05-27 22:40 UTC - kode54
- S3M reader defaults to maximum (128) global volume when the header value is
  either zero or greater than 64. (darkness2.s3m)

2006-05-23 00:06 UTC - kode54
- Changed module format load order priority to check all signatures before
  attempting MOD now, and then only 15 sample module for MOD/MDZ. This should
  hopefully cut back on problems with N formats renamed to MOD.
- Version is now 0.9.7.4

2006-05-22 21:44 UTC - kode54
- XM reader now supports up to 256 instruments, even though FT2 only
  supports up to 128. ModPlug Tracker again. (no_utndgs2.xm)
- g_open_module now supports other files misnamed as .MOD (hilse.mod .it)

2006-05-22 18:43 UTC - kode54
- XM reader now ignores when instrument header contains a sample header size
  of 0, when it should be 0x28. (neptune_*.xm)
- S3M reader was using the incorrect index into component for sample packing
  when reading sample data. Was using n, should have been m.

2006-05-22 17:26 UTC - kode54
- IT renderer may have a bug with its time_lost / loop handling. Switchover
  from sustain loop would compound time_lost onto itself for every note-off.
  I'm not sure if this crap is even doing the right thing, especially in the
  case of a sample with a sustain loop, but no main loop. Working around for
  now by zeroing time_lost after note-off. (hall8.it)
- S3M reader ignores effects outside of 1-25 range so nothing can hit
  internal effects which are XM or PTM only. (N4.S3M)
- IT reader now supports ModPlug Tracker extensions for up to 4000 samples
  and mapping them with instruments. (hallowe.it.it)
- XM reader now supports instrument vibrato 4, random. Yet another ModPlug
  extension. (hcw-st.xm)

2006-05-21 02:11 UTC - kode54
- S3M reader correctly reads all 24 bits of the sample memory segment
  offset, fixing at least one file with >1MB of sample data (d-t-x_x.s3m)
- XM reader stops reading instruments when it has at least one valid
  instrument and encounters an error, fixing at least one file with
  too high instrument count in the header (drx-chri.xm)
- IT reader ignores instrument header signatures, since there seem to
  be files with bad signatures on unused/filler instruments (dsouls.it)
- MOD reader can now be restricted to handling 31 sample files with
  legal/known signatures only, so frontend can fall back on restricted
  MOD loading for files with incorrect extensions (dreamer_0g.s3m)
- Version is now 0.9.7.2

2006-05-20 xx:xx UTC - kode54

  instead of using tables.

2004-10-05 19:38 UTC - kode54
- Implemented instrument random volume and panning variation, but maybe the offset should be a member of IT_CHANNEL
  instead of IT_PLAYING...

2004-10-05 19:03 UTC - kode54
